%  so.
clear all, close all, clc % clearing and preparing a clean workspace.
% Loading your data into the workspace. 
% Do not change the following line.
load('A1Data.mat','msg','fs','st1','st2','st3');
% m2 variable is used for Part 2.
% fs is the sampling frequency.
% kf2 is the frequency deviation factor. 

%==========================================================================
% Below are the variables you MUST use throughout your assignment.
% Failure to adhere to the names will result in your group losing marks.
% Not all variables may be referenced in the assignment brief. However, it
% is a good idea to examine these vectors and make sure they are what you
% expect them to be.
% 
% ------- Part 1
% fc1 - carrier frequency
% c1 - carrier
% m1 - message
% kf1 - frequency sensitivity factor
% y1 - modulated signal (time domain)
% Y1 - modulated signal (frequency domain) - Fourier transform only
% 
% ------ Part 2
% m2 - message
% fs - sample rate
% kf2 - frequency sensitivity factor
% t2 - time vector
% BW_FM - theoretical bandwidth
% fc2 - carrier frequency
% s - modulated signal
% y2 - modulated signal after passing through channel
% mr - demodulated signal
